# Classification_LoanDefault
### Description: 
This project involves predicting the loan eligibility of bank customers using classification algorithms to help the bank prevent potential losses, and focus more on eligible customers.

----------------

### Skills & Tools:

Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression,  EDA, Multi- & Bi-variate Anaylsis, Microsoft Powerpoint, Scipy, Sklearn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

----------------

### Context: 

Non-Performing Assets are a big burden for any banking system. The biggest contributor for this is the non-payment of the loan amount or loan defaulters. 
There are multiple considerations for approving a loan. However, when these processes are done manually, they are prone to erorr and bias, as well as very laborious.

----------------

### Objective:

The objective of this problem is to build a classification model to predict clients who are likely to default on their loan,  and subsequently give recommendations to the bank on the important features to consider while approving a loan.
